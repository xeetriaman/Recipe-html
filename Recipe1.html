<p>Creamy, mildly-spiced and full of fantastic flavour â€“ this classic Indian chicken curry is an international favourite
    that's super easy to rustle up at home. In just 30 minutes you can be tucking into a silky curry with warming heat
    from tandoori masala and fresh chillies, which is balanced perfectly with velvety butter and indulgent double cream
</p>

    <LI>4 tbsp tandoori masala spice mix</LI>
    <LI>3 garlic cloves, crushed</LI>
    <LI>1 onion, finely chopped</LI>
    <LI>1-2 green chillies, finely chopped</LI>
    <LI>2 tbsp olive oil</LI>
    <LI>2 cardamom pods</LI>
    <LI>1 cinnamon stick</LI>
    <LI>1 tsp chilli powder, to taste</LI>
    <LI>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</LI>
    <LI>25g butter</LI>
    <LI>150ml double cream or natural yogurt</LI>
    <LI>boiled basmati rice and naan breads, to serve (optional)</LI>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Put the chicken in a small mixing bowl. Add 2 tbsp tandoori masala spice mix and 1 crushed garlic clove. Stir
        well, cover and set aside in the fridge to marinate for 1 hour or at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining crushed garlic, onion and green chillies to a large frying pan with 1 tbsp olive oil and fry
        over a medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the cardamom pods and cinnamon and continue to cook for 2 minutes, or
        until the onions are golden brown. Add the remaining tandoori masala spice mix and chilli powder to taste and
        cook for 1 minute before adding the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Simmer over a low heat for 6-8 minutes. </li>
    <li>In a separate pan, melt the butter with the remaining olive oil, then add the chicken pieces and fry over a
        medium heat for 3-4 minutes. Add the cooked chicken to the tomato sauce and continue cooking for a further 5
        minutes until cooked through with no pink meat remaining. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to stand for 5
        minutes before adding the double cream (or yogurt) and mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Serve with boiled basmati rice.</li>
    <p>
    <h4>Tip:</h4>
    To make the curry go further, add a tin of drained and rinsed chickpeas to the pan when you add the chopped
    tomatoes. When you take the curry off the heat, stir through a bag of ready washed baby spinach. It will wilt in the
    heat of the sauce and add great flavour and colour to the dish!
